# AI Usage Statement

This project was developed with assistance from ChatGPT, used primarily as a helper and debugging assistant for when I got stuck. It was used in the following ways:

### Guidance and Explanation
- Helping understand RISC-V numeric operation rules (ADD/SUB flags, RV32M division semantics, float32 encoding).
- Providing conceptual explanations of two’s-complement, ripple-carry adders, and bit-vector operations.

### Code Review and Corrections
- Suggesting improvements when test cases revealed mismatches against the RISC-V specification.
- Helping identify errors in signed division behavior, IEEE-754 rounding differences, and correct operand encodings.

### Test Writing Assistance
- Assisting in drafting test cases that match assignment requirements.
- Ensuring each module has comprehensive coverage of edge cases.

###  Documentation Assistance
- Helping structure this README, AI_USAGE.md, and ai_report.json in a clean, academic-appropriate way.

### What AI Did *Not* Do
- AI did **not** generate the contents of the project unless marked with "AI-BEGIN" / "AI-END".
- AI did **not** provide automated full code dumps without modification from me.
- Each module was created manually, validated every function, and ensured all code complied with assignment restrictions.

All AI-assisted suggestions were reviewed, edited, and fully understood before being incorporated.
